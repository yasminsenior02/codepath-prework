2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
A challenge I faced while creating this submission was creating ways to incorporate creativity and originality into my project without dismantling the basic structure. Since the project already had a structure, it was challenging to think about how I could make my project stand out from the original game. The task of the project was clear; to create a light and sound memory game. At first I thought about how I could apply my previous HTML skills to make the game more effective and attractive to the user. Applying these skills, I changed the colors of the background, text, and buttons using a color wheel being that adding bright colors to my game will initially catch the user’s attention. While applying the color wheel, it was important to have a scheme to limit distractions from the game’s overall purpose. Other than colors, I wanted the game to be more challenging for the user. Using this I altered the game’s cue hold and pause times so that it would be more difficult to remember the fast moving button. After a few times of trying this myself, it ended up even being a struggle for me. With this strategy, the user will probably get stumped and want to interact with the game more in order to win.


3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
The following questions I have about web development are :

Can HTML allow web developers to have more creative control than CSS and javascript?
Can front end coding also serve as a way to research user interaction with websites?
How can I fully combine design and web development as a technical job ?
Are there other languages other than HTML, javascript, and CSS that are beneficial to web development?
What are some stable jobs within web development?


4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

If I had a few more hours to work on this project I would try to find a more efficient way to randomize the start of the game. Applying my python skills, I tried to make the game random instead of having the same order every time at the start. I tried first with using Import Random on var pattern and also making it an empty list. Unfortunately this did not work, leading me to do more research with front end coding. Since the global variables are in javascript, I researched how to implement the random start. After research I found a shuffle function, yet it still did not work. Also if i had more time I would have implemented the active background of the buttons to be images. I feel like this would’ve allowed me to showcase more of my creativity and made my project stand out.
